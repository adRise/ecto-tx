* 0.3.0

- Move the handling of single-branched `if`/`unless` inside bind syntax
  + Remove the handling of nil as pure(nil), because it breaks some Ecto functions that is expected to returns nil
- Remove the feature handling list of Tx.t as Tx.t
  + It was removed because it breaks Ecto functions that returns lists
  + You must now invoke Tx.concat/1 on a list of Tx.t(a) to get a Tx.t([a])
